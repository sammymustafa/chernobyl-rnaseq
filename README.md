# RNA-Seq Deep-Dive into Post-Chernobyl Radiation-Induced TC

## Overview
In this comprehensive analysis, I delve into the intricate details of gene expression changes associated with post-Chernobyl radiation-induced pediatric thyroid carcinomas (TC). Utilizing RNA-Seq differential mRNA data from Ricarte-Filho et al. (2013), the study focuses on identifying key kinase fusion oncogenes and delineating the pathways implicated in these specific TC occurrences.

## Objectives
* Pathway Identification: To confirm the involvement of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), P13K/Akt, and MAPK pathways, highly prevalent in thyroid carcinomas, as reported by Liu et al. (2008).
* Gene Expression Profiling: Analyze the expression of over 25,000 genes to identify those that are up- and down-regulated in TC, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms of the disease.
* Oncogene Discovery: Pinpoint specific kinase fusion oncogenes contributing to the oncogenic phenotypes in pediatric TC.

## Techniques and Data Analysis
* Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA): Employing GSEA with the KEGG pathway functional database on WebGestalt to identify the most significantly affected pathways in TC.
* Data Handling and Visualization: Using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for processing and visualizing the vast RNA-Seq data.
* Statistical Analysis: Applying rigorous statistical methods to ascertain the significance of gene expression changes and pathway involvements.
* Targeted Oncogene Search: Concentrating on receptor tyrosine kinases and related pathways, the analysis aims to uncover potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

By exploring the gene expression landscape of post-Chernobyl radiation-induced TC, this study aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the molecular alterations in thyroid carcinomas and potentially guide the development of targeted therapies.
