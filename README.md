# RNA-Seq Deep-Dive into Post-Chernobyl Radiation-Induced TC

Here, I used RNA-Seq differential mRNA data (Ricarte-Filho et al., 2013) to identify kinase fusion oncogenes playing key-roles in the gene expression underlying post-Chernobyl radiation-induced pediatric thyroid carcinomas (TC). By studying the gene expression of over 25000 genes, this analysis highlight the up- and down-regulated genes within this specific occurrence of TC as well as narrow down the pathways involved in these processes.
